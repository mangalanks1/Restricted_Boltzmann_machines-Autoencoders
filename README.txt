The notebook : Autoencoder Experiments.ipynb contains the autoencoder experiments
The notebook : Denoising Autoencoder Experiments.ipynb contains the Denoising autoencoder experiments
The notebook : RBM Experiments.ipynb contains the RBM experiments

The Autoencoder & Denoising Autoencoder networks have been implemented in Autoencoder_utils.py
The RBM functions are implemented in RBM_utils.py
Simple Neural network is implemented in utils.py

The main functions corresponding to all the 3 networks are implemented in the respective notebooks under the Train network heading.
